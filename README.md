# File-Cleanup-Script
 In large organizations or personal systems where many files accumulate over time, managing disk  space becomes crucial. A file cleanup script can automate this process by deleting unnecessary or outdated files. This is especially  useful in server environments, where logs, backups, or temporary files can take up valuable disk space.
